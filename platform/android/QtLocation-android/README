This is a hacked version of QtLocation version 1.0
It gives working GPS updates on Android when used with the javaloader written
specifically for it
The QtLocation implementation is otherwise incomplete - requests to start/stop
updates, change their frequency etc. are ignored.

Compile with:
    qmake location.pro
    make

install manually.
